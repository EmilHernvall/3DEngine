## Simple 3D Engine

This is an experiment with 3d graphics that I did in September 2011. I had wanted to get started
with 3d (for game development, visualization and so forth) for a long time, but never gotten around
to it. I finally decided to give it a shot and wrote a software rasterizer. I decided to do it from
scratch to get an opportunity to learn about the principles in-depth.

Since this was/is a learning project, I've been keeping notes. You can read them if you want,
and laugh at how little I understand. They are in this repos under notes.txt. :)

Right now the project is a working renderer with support for gouraud shading. It works pretty well,
except for some clipping issues. I've added some screenshots that you can look at if you want
to get a feel for it. I plan to add support for textures, and eventually develop this into some
really simple game (an fps or something like that). I'm a bit curious about BSP trees, so I'll
probably look into integrating that as well.
